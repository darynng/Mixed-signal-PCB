# Mixed-signal-PCB

## Project Description:
This project was focused on the end-to-end design of complex mixed-signal printed circuit boards. The work was divided into four major sections: component selection, schematic design, stack-up and placement, and final layout planning.
Key schematic blocks designed included an Ethernet PHY (10/100 Mb/s), an I2S DAC for audio output, a MEMS microphone, a 24-bit ADC, 36W bi-directional brushed DC motor drivers, UART-to-USB TTL converters, and both an STM32F103 microcontroller (used as debugger/programmer) and an STM32F407 as the main system controller. The design also incorporated power supply modules, protection circuits, and several peripheral components.

## Project Outcomes:
By the end of this project, I was able to design multi-layer boards (4, 6, 8, and 12 layers), define stack-ups with proper grounding techniques, and implement rigid-flex PCB structures.This resulted in a set of professional-level schematic and PCB designs suitable for real-world applications.

## Learning Outcomes:
 Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
  -  Extracting component information from requirement sheets and datasheets

  -  Selecting the right components from millions of available options

  -  Designing complex schematic blocks with detailed power budgeting

  -  Using Altium Designer to plan interconnects exceeding 10,000 signals

  -  Improving communication of design decisions through block diagrams, documentation, and visual planning

Most importantly, I learned how to approach a highly complex hardware design project from scratch and carry it through to execution. This experience strengthened my technical expertise in PCB design, troubleshooting, and system-level planningâ€”skills directly applicable to professional hardware engineering roles.
